# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CollabSpec is an intelligent collaboration platform designed to solve the productivity challenges faced by distributed development teams. The platform addresses the core problem where remote teams lose 35% more productivity due to miscommunication, context switching between multiple tools, and outdated documentation. CollabSpec transforms team collaboration by automatically generating living specifications from stakeholder conversations, maintaining real-time synchronization between specs and code changes, and bridging technical/business language through AI translation.

5. WHEN team members join discussions THEN the system SHALL provide relevant historical context automatically

### Requirement 4: Async Workflow Orchestration

**User Story:** As a remote team lead, I want intelligent scheduling across time zones, so that work can continue 24/7 without coordination overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team members work across different time zones THEN the system SHALL intelligently schedule handoffs and preserve context
2. WHEN tasks are created THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal handoff times based on team member time zones
3. WHEN a team member completes work THEN the system SHALL automatically notify the next person in the workflow
4. WHEN conflicts arise in scheduling THEN the system SHALL propose alternative workflows to maintain progress
5. IF team members are offline THEN the system SHALL queue notifications and updates for their next active period
6. WHEN cross-timezone collaboration is needed THEN the system SHALL facilitate async decision-making processes

### Requirement 5: Visual Communication Hub

**User Story:** As a designer, I want diagrams and mockups generated from specifications, so that visual communication happens automatically without manual creation overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifications are created THEN the system SHALL auto-generate relevant diagrams and visual representations
2. WHEN system architecture is discussed THEN the system SHALL create and update architectural diagrams automatically
3. WHEN UI requirements are specified THEN the system SHALL generate mockups and wireframes
4. IF visual elements need updates THEN the system SHALL regenerate them when specifications change
5. WHEN presenting to stakeholders THEN the system SHALL provide visual summaries of complex technical concepts

### Requirement 6: Integration Pipeline

**User Story:** As a development team, I want seamless integration with existing tools, so that we can adopt CollabSpec without disrupting current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tools (Slack/GitHub/Jira) receive updates THEN the system SHALL maintain workflow continuity without requiring tool switching
2. WHEN GitHub events occur THEN the system SHALL synchronize with repository changes in real-time
3. WHEN Slack messages contain project discussions THEN the system SHALL capture and categorize relevant conversations
4. WHEN Jira tickets are updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in related specifications and workflows
5. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
6. WHEN new tools are added THEN the system SHALL support extensible integration patterns

### Requirement 7: Real-time Collaboration Performance

**User Story:** As a distributed team member, I want instant updates across all platforms, so that I can collaborate effectively regardless of location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL propagate updates to all connected users within 500ms
2. WHEN 100+ users are active THEN the system SHALL maintain performance without degradation
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide offline sync capabilities
4. IF real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL queue changes and sync when connection is restored
5. WHEN collaborating simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflict resolution automatically

### Requirement 8: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want browser-based operation with proper access controls, so that sensitive project information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the platform THEN the system SHALL operate entirely within browser security constraints
2. WHEN sensitive information is shared THEN the system SHALL encrypt data transmission using TLS 1.3
3. WHEN team members join or leave THEN the system SHALL update access permissions automatically
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log and block the attempt
5. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL comply with enterprise security requirements

### Requirement 9: Mobile-Responsive Experience

**User Story:** As a remote worker, I want full functionality on mobile devices, so that I can participate in collaboration from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design with full functionality
2. WHEN viewing specifications on small screens THEN the system SHALL optimize layout for readability
