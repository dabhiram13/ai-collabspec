# Collaboration-Focused Development Rules

## Core Principles
- Build for distributed teams working across time zones
- Prioritize async communication over synchronous meetings
- Create self-updating documentation that stays current
- Design for non-technical stakeholders to understand technical decisions

## Communication Standards
- All technical decisions must have business impact summaries
- Use visual representations whenever possible
- Implement progressive disclosure (simple overview â†’ detailed specs)
- Maintain conversation history linked to code changes

## Integration Requirements
- Must work with existing tools (Slack, GitHub, Jira)
- No workflow disruption for team members
- Browser-based operation for security
- Real-time synchronization across team members
